### Features List
#### Emoticons Dialog
A simple emoticons dialog<br>

click smiley icon in chat box to show it <br>
press CTRL + mouse click to add emoticons continuously
	(without closing dialog) <br>

- recent emoticons (you & other users)
- catalog based on <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/">emoji cheat sheet</a>
- smartly add spaces between emoticons and text

#### Chat History & Shortcuts
Search chat history sent by you<br>

1. make sure chat box is empty then press arrow UP<br>
2. press UP/DOWN continuously to search between
			older and newer messages
3. press other keys would stop searching immediately
- chat history up to 20 items

- press ESC to focus chat box (when it's not focused)
- press ESC to clear text in chat box (when it's focused)

#### Auto Woot/Meh
Automatically WOOT/MEH! each song as it is played

Auto-Meh is just for fun, DON'T PRESS IT

#### Auto Queue
Automatically add yourself back to the DJ Waitlist
	once you've been moved back into the crowd

#### Userlist & User-box
A dynamic list of every user in the room,
	color-coded by their current vote. <br>
Green = "Woot", Red = "Meh", White = No vote <br>
Special usergroups (i.e. moderator) are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat<br>
Click any username would show user-box instead of @mention in original script

#### Toggle UI
Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience <br>
Red = Off, Green = On

#### Hide Video
Hides videos from view on the site. <br>
this is in effect until disabled

#### Skip Video
This is exactly like hide video,
	except it additionally mutes the audio and will automatically re-enable
	everything after the current video is over

#### Open Video Link
Open video link (YouTube) in new tab
	without "?feature=player_embedded" in URL

-----
### Improvement

#### Performance
You may notice this script would be less laggy when switching song
	in large room with over 150 people than original script.<br>

#### Skipping Video
Properly resumes volume and video when switching song

#### Changing room
Auto-woots and auto-queues when room changes,
	and updates userlist immediately

#### "This session has now ended. Goodbye."
It's usually annoying when you're playing fullscreen game,
	a popup of this message shows and you return to desktop and player dies in game,
	so I suppress this message. <br>
But you still need to refresh page when session dies
